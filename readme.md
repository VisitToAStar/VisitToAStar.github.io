### CSS
```css
h1          /* Selects level 1 headings              */
p           /* Selects paragraphs                    */
.caption    /* Selects elements with class "caption" */
#subnav     /* Selects element with ID "subnav"      */
```

CSS rules can be included directly within the head of a document, like so
```html
<head>
    <style type="text/css">
        p {
            font-family: sans-serif;
            color: lime;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```
or saved in an external file with a .css suffix, and then referenced in the documentâ€™s head:
```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
### Javascript

```html
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        alert("Hello, world!");
    </script>
</body>
```
or stored in a separate file, and then referenced somewhere the HTML (commonly in the head):

```html
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="myscript.js"></script>
</head>
```

### `class` and `id`

```html
<div id="vis"></div>
<h1><span class = "welcome">JavaScript library for data visulization overview</span></h1>
```
In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (`.`) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (`#`).

```css
.welcome { font-style:italic; color:red; }
span {border          :1px solid black;
      background-color:cyan;  }
```


### Problems need to be solved
1. I have a serious problems, which I can only display one vega-lite example in a webpage, how to display multiple examples?
2. Contents of html file only contains `<script>`, `<script>` and what's in between.
